# Surplus scout

# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
#
# This app should be used to elucidate the surplus land of Schools
# based on PDS data and Google Earth like mapping
# and determine where there is potential for building
# additional capacity in relation to School Capacity and Planning data by LA
